Developed a user-friendly web application that predicts health scores based on key lifestyle factors using machine learning. Collect and preprocess data (age, weight, height, exercise, sleep, etc.), handling missing values and outliers. Train a predictive model (e.g., linear regression) for accurate health score estimation. Provide personalized recommendations on exercise, sleep, and other factors. Enable users to compare their scores with others in their age group for motivation. Build an intuitive interface using Streamlit and HTML/CSS to enhance user experience. This tool aims to offer actionable health insights, promoting proactive health management amidst rising health awareness
